# BSTGuesser_GoogleACS

This workshop's app is a visualization of a binary search tree that contains the values 1 through 20. The order in which the values are inserted will be randomized causing the tree to take on a shape unique to that input sequence. The user is then challenged to guess the location of any given node within the tree.
